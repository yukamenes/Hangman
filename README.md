# Hangman Game ðŸŽ®

This is a simple console-based Hangman game written in Python. The player tries to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. 
The game gives feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, and displays a visual hangman to show the playerâ€™s remaining lives.

## Features
- **Random Word Selection**: Each game session starts with a randomly chosen word from a list.
- **Guess Tracking**: The game shows letters that have already been guessed and provides feedback on each guess.
- **Life System**: Players start with 6 lives, with one life lost for each incorrect guess.
- **Visual Stages**: Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to the complete hangman figure.

## Project Structure
- `hangman_art.py`: Contains ASCII art for the game's logo and each stage of the hangman figure.
- `hangman_words.py`: Contains a list of possible words for the game.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `hangman_art.py` and `hangman_words.py` files in the same directory as the main script.

2. Run the hangman.py script
